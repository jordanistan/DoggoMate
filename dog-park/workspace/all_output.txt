EntryPoint File: app.py

This file will serve as the entry point for the application. It will contain the main function that initializes the app and starts the server.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api
from resources import MenuResource, PaymentResource, TippingResource, NotificationResource

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

api.add_resource(MenuResource, '/menu')
api.add_resource(PaymentResource, '/payment')
api.add_resource(TippingResource, '/tip')
api.add_resource(NotificationResource, '/notification')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Resources File: resources.py

This file will contain the resources that the app will use. Each resource will handle a specific endpoint and its corresponding HTTP methods.

```python
from flask_restful import Resource

class MenuResource(Resource):
    def get(self):
        """
        Returns the menu of the dog park/coffee shop
        """
        pass

class PaymentResource(Resource):
    def post(self):
        """
        Processes the payment for the selected products/services
        """
        pass

class TippingResource(Resource):
    def post(self):
        """
        Processes the tip for the selected amount and payment method
        """
        pass

class NotificationResource(Resource):
    def post(self):
        """
        Sends a push notification to the user's device
        """
        pass
```

Backend File: backend.py

This file will contain the backend logic for the app. It will handle user registration and authentication, e-commerce functionality, payment processing, and push notifications.

```python
import squareconnect
from squareconnect.apis import customers_api, payments_api
from squareconnect.models import CreateCustomerRequest, CreateCustomerCardRequest, Money, CreatePaymentRequest, ChargeRequest

class Backend:
    def __init__(self, access_token):
        self.access_token = access_token
        self.customers_api = customers_api.CustomersApi()
        self.payments_api = payments_api.PaymentsApi()
    
    def register_user(self, user_data):
        """
        Registers a new user with the provided user data
        """

    def authenticate_user(self, user_data):
        """
        Authenticates the user with the provided user data
        """
        pass
    
    def browse_products(self):
        """
        Returns the list of available products/services
        """
        pass
    
    def select_products(self, product_ids):
        """
        Selects the products/services with the provided IDs
        """
        pass
    
    def add_payment_method(self, card_data):
        """
        Adds a new payment method for the user with the provided card data
        """
        pass
    
    def process_payment(self, payment_data):
        """
        Processes the payment for the selected products/services with the provided payment data
        """
        pass
    
    def process_tip(self, tip_data):
        """
        Processes the tip for the selected amount and payment method with the provided tip data
        """
        pass
    
    def send_notification(self, notification_data):
        """
        Sends a push notification to the user's device with the provided notification data
        """
        pass
```

Payment Gateway Integration File: payment_gateway.py

This file will contain the logic for integrating the Square payment gateway into the app.

```python
import squareconnect
from squareconnect.apis import locations_api, transactions_api
from squareconnect.models import ChargeRequest, Money

class PaymentGateway:
    def __init__(self, access_token, location_id):
        self.access_token = access_token
        self.location_id = location_id
        self.locations_api = locations_api.LocationsApi()
        self.transactions_api = transactions_api.TransactionsApi()
    
    def charge_card(self, card_data, amount):
        """
        Charges the provided card with the specified amount
        """
        pass
```

Push Notification Service Integration File: push_notification.py

This file will contain the logic for integrating the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notification service into the app.

```python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, messaging

class PushNotification:
    def __init__(self, credentials_path):
        self.credentials_path = credentials_path
        self.cred = credentials.Certificate(credentials_path)
        firebase_admin.initialize_app(self.cred)
    
    def send_notification(self, notification_data):
        """
        Sends a push notification to the user's device with the provided notification data
        """
